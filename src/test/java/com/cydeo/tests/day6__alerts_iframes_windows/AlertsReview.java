    //this will be present inside of the <html> page as some web element.
    ///there is nothing special about this alert, we just locate and click


    //2) javascript alert
    //we have 3 types of alerts =
    //information, = user can only click "OK" on this alert
    //confirmation = user can accept and decline this alert
    //prompt = user can accept, decline, and send keys
