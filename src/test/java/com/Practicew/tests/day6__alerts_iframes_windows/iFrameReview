and iframe is a HTML within another HTML page.
Most of the time it is used to create independent sections in a page for advertisements, maps, video content, or anything independent.\

to handle iframes you can focus the selenium driver on one thing at a time.
we must focus the default frame to iframe in <html>

if we try to locate any web element before switching, we will get NoSuchElementException

1. by index
starts from 0
driver.switchTo().frame(index);

2. by id value
if there is id or name attribute we can pass their values as a string
driver.switchTo().frame("id-name value");


3. by locating as web element
we locate the iframe tag itself as a web element and pass it into the method
driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement);



after switching to a frame, to focus back to the last frame we can
driver.switchTo().parentFrame();
driver.switchTo().defaultContent();
