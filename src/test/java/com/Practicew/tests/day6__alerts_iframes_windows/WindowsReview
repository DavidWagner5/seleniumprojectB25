Window


Tab and window means the same thing in selenium

a window handle is a randomly generated unique alphanumeric id for each window
Every widow has their own window handle randomly generated by selenium.
we dont have to do anything special for it.

we get window handle by .getWindowHandle();
return type is String
it will capture and return the current window handle as a string

to get all of the current window handles
.getWindowHandles(); and return type is Set <String>

Selenium will only return the window handles from the currently executed session.
