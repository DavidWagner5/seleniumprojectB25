- XPATH:

- How many types of xpath do we have?
- 2 types

#1- Absolute xpath:
    - Starts with "/" single slash
    - Starts from the root element -> "html" tag
    - And it goes down 1 by 1
    - Therefore it is not dependable
    - If there is any change happens in the structure of the html page it will break easily

#2- Relative xpath:
    - Starts with "//" double slash
    - "//" means jump to any given point/jump to first matching result

    syntax: //tagName[@attribute='value']


- Can we use "//" more than once in an xpath locator?
- Yes we can. We are not limited to just once. We can use as many time as we want.


- How do we go from parent to direct child?
- "/" will take us to direct child

    //tagName[@attribute='value']/directChildTag


- How do we go from parent to any child?
- "//" will take us to any child.
- It doesn't have to be directly under


- How do we go from child to parent?
- "/.."
- We do not have to provide tag name here. It will just take to the parent.

- How do we handle dynamic web elements?
#1- I can locate a parent/child that is not dynamic and move from there
#2- I will use the methods provided by xpath: contains, starts-with, ends-with

    //tagName[contains(@attribute, 'value')]
    //tagName[starts-with(@attribute, 'value')]
    //tagName[ends-with(@attribute, 'value')]


- How do we go from sibling to sibling?
- There are two methods for going from sibling to sibling
- "/preceding-sibling::" will go to the sibling that comes before
- "/following-sibling::" will go to the sibling that comes after

- The web element we locate will become the starting point (point 0).
- We decide whether we want to go preceding or following sibling.
- We count and we pass the index number.

    //tagName[@attribute='value']



ex:    //option[@value='3']


    <select>
2        <option value="1"> Orange 1</option>
1        <option value="2"> Orange 2</option>
0        <option value="3"> Orange 3</option>
1        <option value="4"> Orange 4</option>
2        <option value="5"> Orange 5</option>
    </select>


//option[@value='3']/preceding-sibling::option[1] --> this will point to Orange 1

//option[@value='3']/following-sibling::option[2] --> this will point to Orange 5
