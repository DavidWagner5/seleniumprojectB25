WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND A DEFECT BUT DEVELOPER DOESNT AGREE
first i would like to say that a defect is different than a bug,
a defect is found during the development phase and a bug is typically found in the testing stage
i understand that finding a defect might resort to some conflict between the tester and developer, so he or she might deny my proposal

first and foremost, i will make sure io understand the requirements or acceptance criteria
so before, i must make sure that the defect is valid, if it is valid, i will talk to the developer
I will also take screenshots so i have proof of the defect.
if the developer denies this defect, I will contact the developer and make sure we are understanding each other.
If he/she still believes it is not valid,
I will most likely go to the business team to get more clarity or clarification
on the user story itself, then we can properaly decide what must be done and the best way to fix the defect.


HOW DO YOU RUN YOUR REGRESSION
how i run my regressions testing in my company
2 types of regression testing minor and major rewgression tests
first one we make sure that all the functionalities are working properly
so we have our previous template and a when the new functionalities are implemented, we can run our minor regression
The application has to be working as expected for a passing regression test
if it doesn't for some reason, then we would have a failed regression test and rethink our approach or strategies
For major regression we actually run before every release and it runs all of the developed functionalities
we have about 800 test scenarios in my team
We set up regression through jenkins and in the morning i make sure that my jenkins report isn't failing
I like to run my regression testing during the night because it can take up to 7 hours for it to complete
it's set up to run during a specific time of day, so that is usually when i check my email report.
We use pipeline through jenkins so we can actually run our regression through different browsers such as chrome and firefox




HOW DO YOU IMPLEEMENT CICD
SO CICD REFERS TO CONTINUOUS INT AND CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT
IN MY CURRENT PROJECT WE IMPLEMENT CICD BY USING JENKINS AND GITHUB, I USE JENKINS TO RUN MY SMOKE AND REGRESSION SUITE
THESE TWO TOOLS HELP US ACHIEVE CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AND CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT
SO MOST IMPORTANTLY THE DEVELOPERS IN MY TEAM PREFORM UNIT AND INTEGRATION STAGES and  i should also mention THEY ARE ABLE TO GENERATE PIPELINES
THEN THE DEVELOPERS ARE ABLE TO SEND IT TO THE QA ENVIRONMENT SO THAT I CAN TEST IF THE FEATURES ARE BUG FREE
IN JENKINS A UNIQUE LINE IS WRITTEN THAT IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO THE FEATURES WITHIN THE REPOSITORY
ALSO, I SHOULD INCLUDE THAT SINCE JENKINS IS ABLE TO OPERATE AND SEND INFORMATION ON A SET SCHEDULE, A TIME IS ADDED SO THAT I RECEIEVE REPORTS AT THE SAME TIME EACH DAY
IN JENKINS I ACTUALLY NEED TO PROVIDE MY GIT REPOSITORY INFO AS WELL SO IT CAN PROPERLY LINK TOGETHER
THE REPORTS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GIVES ME INFORMATION ON EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE TEST THAT TOOK PLACE,
THIS WAY JENKINS IS ABLE TO CONTINOUSLY RUN THE MOST UPDATED VERSION THAT IS PROVIDED


WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU
i believe i have all the knowledge and skills needed to hold a position as a QA or SDET
I am confident in my techncial abilities such as test automation and manal testing
i can also use various tools and multiple platforms to get my job done
this also means that if i am needed to perform a task on some tool or platform that im not familiar with
i can easily translate my skillset so that i can be well aquainted and learn effeciently

i come from an educational background and a college background so i udnerstand hard work
I find that the most value in a hard worker has to with the time that they put in and dedication
i am very dedicated to getting my work done

i also am a great communicator and self advocate. I think in my past company i was able to build strong
connections with people because of my speaking skills
